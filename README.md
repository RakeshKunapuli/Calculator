This My simple and Plain project where i build a calculator which calculates numbers and decimalvalues and also you can check The percentage of amount by clicking the 
percentage number => then symbol "%" => then "*" => then amount from which you want to find Percentage 

i.e ((50) + % = 0.5) ,
 (0.5 * 100 = 50)
